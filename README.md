EXPTNO.8a Program to find Find the simple interest

### Aim: To Write a Python Program to find Find the simple interest by getting the principal, rate and time value from the user
### Algorithm:

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Define a function.

STEP 3: Create variable 'p','r','t' for principal,rate of interest and time. STEP 4: Get the input of p,r and t from user.

STEP 5 : Using the formula (p*r*t)/100 calculate the result. STEP 6: Print the result.

STEP 7: Stop.

### Program:
```
def simpleInterest(p,t,r):
      si = p*t*r/100
       return si
p = eval(input())
r = eval(input())
t = eval(input())
```

### Result: Thus, the given program is implemented and executed successfully .

EXPTNo.8b program to display elements from a list, present at odd index positions

### Aim: To Write a python program to display elements from a list, present at odd index positions
### Algorithm:

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Define a function.

STEP 3: Create a list and a variable a.

STEP 4: Get the input of a from user.

STEP 5 : Using loop get the inputs and append in list.

STEP 6: Using another loop print the elements in the odd index position of the list. 

STEP 7: Stop.

### Program:
```
def odd(a):
         l=[]
          for i in range(a):
x = int(input())
l.append(x)
for i in range(a):
           if i%2!=0:
                print(l[i], end=" ")
 a = int(input())
odd(a)
```

EXPT NO>8C To Write a python program to Given the participants'	score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score
### Aim: To Write a python program to Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them 
         in a list and find the score of the runner-up.


### Algorithm:
STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Create a variable n.

STEP 3: Get the value of n from user.

STEP 4: Get the number of inputs from user and split the input and append in a list. STEP 5: Using set function remove duplicates from the list.

STEP 6: Using sort function reorder the list in ascending order. STEP 7: Print the result.

STEP 8: Stop.


### Program:
```if  name	== '   main    ':
          n = int(input())
          arr = map(int, input().split())
          arr2 = list(set(arr))
          arr2.sort()
print(arr2[-2])

EX: 8.d program to square all the even numbers and cube all odd numbers from a list of integers
### Aim: To Develop a python program to square all the even numbers and cube all odd numbers from a list of integers. Get the starting and ending range to create a list.


### Algorithm:

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Create a variable f and l for upper and lower limit of list. STEP 3: Get the value of f and l from user.

STEP 4: Create a list.

STEP 5 : Get the input from user and append in the list. STEP 6: Create a lambda function to calculate the result. STEP 7: Print the result.

STEP 8 : Stop.

### Program:
```
cube = lambda x: x**2 if x%2==0 else x**3
def fun(f,l):
     l1=[]
     for i in range(f,l+1):
           l1.append(i)
      return l1
f,l = int(input()),int(input())

```
